# EmoSuggest: Mood-Based Activity Suggestion 

EmotiGuide is an innovative project aimed at suggesting activities based on the user's mood, utilizing image emotion detection techniques. By leveraging machine learning and deep learning models, EmotiGuide can analyze images to determine the user's emotional state and recommend relevant activities tailored to their mood.
## Features
Image Emotion Detection: Utilizes deep learning models like MobileNet to detect emotions from user-provided images.
Activity Suggestion: Recommends activities based on the detected emotion, providing personalized suggestions for the user.

## Technologies Used
Python Libraries:
    NumPy
    Pandas
    Matplotlib
Deep Learning Framework:
    Keras
Pre-trained Models:
    MobileNet for image emotion detection
Image Data Processing:
    ImageDataGenerator for preprocessing images
Loss Function:
    Categorical Crossentropy for model training

## How It Works
Image Input: Users upload or provide images representing their current mood.
Emotion Detection: EmoSuggest utilizes MobileNet to analyze the images and detect the predominant emotion.
Activity Recommendation: Based on the detected emotion, EmotiGuide suggests relevant activities from a predefined set.
